# pihole-install

This repo contains instructions for setting up a PiHole DNS server with a Raspberry Pi for a home wireless router.

## Pre-Installation

* PiHole is a DNS server, so your wireless router must be configured to use it.  Whether your wireless router is builtin to the modem provided by your ISP, or whether you have your own wireless router that you have connected to the modem, you must be able to change its configuration settings.
    * Following the instructions provided by your ISP or that came with your wireless router, log into the administration console.  This might be done via an app on your phone, or it might be done via a webpage that is hosted on the router.
    * Find the settings that allow you to specify your DNS server.  Write the existing IP address, the one specified by your ISP, down somewhere.  If things don't work, you'll want to restore this setting.  Here is what the [DNS settings](orbi.png) look like for my [Orbi wireless router](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0D526GSYY):
    * Once your PiHole is configured, you will come back to this setting and change the IP address to that of the PiHole.
    * If your wireless router does not allow you to change the DNS server, you cannot use a PiHole.
